# The Room: style guide for later builders

Parts 2 to 6 each add one agent. This file is everything you need to draw one that
matches. Read it together with `src/agents/Agent1.sol`, which is the reference drawing.

## The scene

- Canvas: `viewBox="0 0 480 330"`, no width/height attributes. Flat colours, no gradients,
  no filters, no external assets, no fonts other than `monospace`.
- View: side view, the agent sits on the **left** of its desk and faces **right** toward the
  monitor. Every agent faces right. Nothing is drawn in perspective.
- Wall from y = 0 to 110, floor from 110 to 330. A window sits at (195, 18) 90 x 50. A sign
  reading `THE ROOM` starts at (20, 36) in the top-left corner. Do not draw over the
  window or the sign.
- Six desks in a 3 x 2 grid. Desk top-left corners:

| desk | x   | y   |
|------|-----|-----|
| 1    | 40  | 130 |
| 2    | 200 | 130 |
| 3    | 360 | 130 |
| 4    | 40  | 240 |
| 5    | 200 | 240 |
| 6    | 360 | 240 |

  Each desk top is 90 wide and 8 tall, with legs down to y + 50 and a nameplate
  40 x 13 at (x + 25, y + 16). The nameplate text is `deskLabel(desk)` and is drawn by
  the room, never by an agent.

## Desk-local coordinates

An agent is drawn as if its desk's top-left corner were `(0, 0)`. `Room.agentSvg` wraps
the drawing in `<g transform="translate(x y)">` for the right desk. Rules:

- The desk top occupies x = 0..90, y = 0..8. Do not draw over it.
- The chair and body live at **x = -34..0**. Nothing may go left of x = -36. Desks are
  160 apart and 90 wide, so the gap between a mug and the next chair is about 34 units.
- Nothing may go above **y = -60**. Row 1 desks sit at y = 130, so y = -60 is canvas
  y = 70, just under the window's bottom edge at 68. The sign sits above desk 1's
  head-room and is clear of every agent box.
- Nothing may go below **y = 44** (the chair base). Row 1 legs run to y = 50 anyway.
- Nothing may go right of **x = 90** (the desk edge).
- Keep everything on integer or half-integer coordinates.

The bounding box for one agent, including its chair and computer, is therefore
`x: -36..90`, `y: -60..44`.

## Anatomy of an agent (Agent 1 as reference)

| part      | element                                            | colour        |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| chair     | back 6 x 50 at (-34, -34); seat 30 x 5 at (-32, 12); post 4 x 24 at (-19, 17); base 26 x 3 at (-30, 40) | `#3d4460` |
| legs      | rounded rect 24 x 8 at (-24, 4)                   | body dark     |
| torso     | rounded rect 18 x 34 at (-26, -26), rx 4          | body          |
| arm       | stroke width 5, round caps, from (-14, -16) to the keyboard at (6, -4) | body |
| head      | rounded rect 22 x 20 at (-28, -50), rx 5          | shell         |
| visor     | rounded rect 12 x 6 at (-20, -44)                 | visor         |
| antenna   | 2px line up from the head, 2.5 r circle on top    | shell, accent |
| keyboard  | 26 x 4 at (4, -4)                                 | `#3d4460`     |
| monitor   | frame 44 x 36 at (36, -44) rx 3; screen 38 x 30 at (39, -41); stand 4 x 9 at (56, -9); base 20 x 3 at (48, -3) | frame, screen |
| screen    | code lines: 2px strokes at y = -37, -32, -27, -22; blinking cursor 4 x 2 at (42, -19) | visor, shell |
| mug       | 7 x 9 at (82, -9), rx 1                            | accent        |

Keep the chair, keyboard, monitor and mug exactly as in Agent 1 so the row reads as one
office. Change the **agent**: its shape, colours (from the palette below), what is on its
screen, what it holds, what sits on its desk. A cat, a plant, a second monitor, a coffee,
headphones, a hat are all fine. The agent must be visibly *working*: hands at the keyboard
and something on the screen.

Every agent must include the `<animate>` on its cursor (or an equivalent single, subtle
animation). One animation per agent, `dur` 1s to 3s, no `<script>`.

| MUTED      | `#8b93ad` | sign text                 |

Agent (pick from these; add at most one new accent per agent):

| name      | hex       | use                              |
|-----------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| CHAIR     | `#3d4460` | chair, keyboard, monitor stand   |
| FRAME     | `#30364a` | monitor frame                    |
| SCREEN    | `#101522` | screen background                |
| SHELL     | `#e6e9f0` | robot head / light body parts    |
| VISOR     | `#35d0b5` | visor, code lines (teal)         |
| ACCENT    | `#f5a860` | antenna tip, mug (orange)        |
| BODY      | `#6d7fa3` | Agent 1 torso and arm (slate)    |
| BODY_DARK | `#5b6f99` | Agent 1 legs                     |
| extra     | `#7cc0ff` | light blue, free for agents 2-6  |
| extra     | `#e07a8a` | rose, free for agents 2-6        |
| extra     | `#9bd36a` | green, free for agents 2-6       |

Give each new agent its own body colour so the six are distinguishable at a glance, but keep
the shell, chair and screen colours shared.

## Size budget

- The room and desks: 1,133 bytes (budget 2,000). Do not touch them.
- Agent 1: 1,294 bytes (budget 1,500 per agent). Measure yours with
  `bytes(room.agentSvg(N)).length` in a test, exactly as `test/Room.t.sol` does.
- Runtime: 6,552 bytes after part 1. EIP-170 allows 24,576. Five more agents at
  roughly 1.5 KB of SVG each (plus concat overhead) fit; do not add libraries.
- Byte-saving habits used here: no whitespace between tags, `<g fill=..>` to share a fill,
  `<path d="M..h..">` for straight lines, one `rx` value, no `stroke-linejoin`,
  short ids. Keep numbers as short as possible.

## How to add agent N

1. Create `src/agents/AgentN.sol`: a `library AgentN` with
   `function draw() internal pure returns (string memory)` returning the desk-local
   drawing. Keep `string.concat` calls to at most about twelve arguments each or the
   compiler runs out of stack (no `via_ir`).
2. In `src/Room.sol`, add `if (desk == N) return AgentN.draw();` to `_agentDrawing`, and
   set `AGENTS = N`.
3. Update `test/Room.t.sol`: expected `agentCount`, the labels (desk N now reads
   `desk N`), the `translate(x y)` anchor count, and add a budget test for agent N.
4. Re-render `room.svg` (see README) and update the byte counts in README and here.
5. Do not change `RoomLayout.sol`, `Agent1.sol`, or any earlier agent.
